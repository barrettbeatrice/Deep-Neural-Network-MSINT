# Deep-Neural-Network-MSINT

The code demonstrates how to build and train a deep neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. After training for 10 epochs, the model achieves a certain accuracy on the test set. Additionally, the code shows how to save and load trained models, and how to use the model to make predictions on new, unseen data, including custom images.
